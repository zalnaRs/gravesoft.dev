# Clean Install Windows

Guide on how to backup your data and clean install Windows.

---

## Prerequisites

- A genuine Windows ISO file, you can download from https://msdl.gravesoft.dev/
- The latest version of Rufus from https://rufus.ie/
- A minimum 8GB USB drive  
- Follow this [guide](remove_malware.md) before making a bootable USB if you think the system has malware.
<details>
  <summary>Another clean system if your current system is infected with File infector malware.</summary>

  **Why?**  
  Because file infector malware can copy itself to the bootable USB that you are going to make to perform a clean installation.  
  You need to use another clean system to make a bootable USB and plug it into the current infected system only when it's not running live Windows.  
  **How to check if you have file infector malware?**  
  Open PowerShell as admin and enter  
  `sc.exe start "sppsvc" > $null 2>&1; Write-Host "Error code: $LASTEXITCODE"`  
  If the output is 577 or 225, then most likely chances are that the system is infected with File infector malware.

## Back up your data

The clean installation process will format the C drive where Windows is installed; if you have any data in the C drive, you need to back it up.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="multiple_partition" label="I have multiple partitions on my drive, like C:\ D:\" default>

- You can copy your data from C drive and paste it into other partitions.
- Your data is usually located in the below place on the C drive,  
  - Go to this folder `C:\Users` and then select the user account that you are using.
  - Your data is saved in Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, and Videos folders.
  - Save these folders in another partition to backup.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="one_partition" label="I have C:\ drive only" default>

- Your data is usually located in the below place on the C drive,  
  - Go to this folder `C:\Users` and then select the user account that you are using.
  - Your data is saved in Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, and Videos folders.
- If you have a **small amount of data** to back up, save it on the below listed online drives or the USB drive after making it bootable with Rufus.
- If you have a **large amount of data** that you can't save on an external drive or online drive,  
  - Create another partition using this guide https://youtu.be/_HgjasKuOBw
  - Save your data onto that other newly created partition.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Create a bootable USB with Rufus

- Plug your USB drive into the system. (Its data will be deleted.)
- Launch Rufus which you downloaded earlier.
- In the "Device" dropdown, select your USB flash drive.
- Boot Selection:
  - Click "SELECT" and choose your Windows ISO file. Rufus will auto-configure optimal settings.
- Click "START."
- Wait for Rufus to create the bootable USB. It may take several minutes. You'll see "READY" when done.

## Reinstall Windows

- Disconnect all external or non-boot internal drives to reduce installation risks.
- Restart your PC and boot from the USB flash drive, typically accessed by pressing F11 or F12 during startup. If it's not working for you then google for example "Asus Zephyrus G14 boot menu key" and find the results for your model number.
- Follow on-screen instructions.
<Tabs>
<TabItem name="old_installer" label="Old Installer" default>

  - Choose "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)" for a clean install.
  - Delete all partitions on the boot drive, or if you want to save data partitions then delete only the C drive and other small system partitions, and select the unallocated space created.
  - Click "Next" to start the installation. Windows will auto-create the necessary partitions.
